			<p>Hello, my name is David Soller.  I'm an aspiring computer scientist attempting to make my impact on the world through software development.  Software development from my prospective is the perfect combination of design, creation, and collaboration.  The element of design effects backend creation as well as the final user product.  Evident throughout the software in simplistic but meaningful ways such as button placement and content portrayal.  Creation is at the developmental core.  Creation is the job, and is used to accomplish it.  Finally, software development is based around collaboration.  We take in building blocks, rearrange & reorder them, in order to design and create a finished product.</p>

					<h1>Bishop Watterson High School</h1>
					<p>I graduated in June of 2013.  It fostered my love of computer science and drove me to pursue it!  At Watterson I took relevant computing classes including Intro the Computer Programming (C++ or Visual Basic), Intro Web Programming, Independent Study in Computers (I focused on web development and Visual Basic), and AP Computer Science (which was a Java course). <a href="http://bishopwatterson.com">Bishop Watterson</a></p>

				<h1>NEWPATH</h1>
				<p>NEWPATH is an IT Entrepreneurship group at OSU.  The group has weekly meetings in which we meet, talk with, and learn from industry professionals.  Additionly, the group allows you interact with other motivated students.  These individuals give you someone to discuss, foster, and revise ideas. <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/ugrad/newpathhome.shtml">NEWPATH</a></p>
				<p>I enjoy the groups discussion about not only ideas but implimentation.  Debating the future of the IT industry and how we want to change it.</p>

				<h1>ESI</h1>
				<p>The ESports Initiative (ESI) is a charity gaming organization at OSU.  ESI proceeds support Nationwide Children's Hospital.  The organization runs numerous tournaments throughout the school year.  Creating a location for gamers to interact for prizes, fellowship, and fun! <a href="http://esi.gg">ESI</a></p>
				<p>In addition to being on staff for the majority of ESI's tournements I am also a member of the IT department.  The IT Department is responsible for website maintenance and creation.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>CWDG</h1>
				<p>The Collegian Web Development Group (CWDG) is an organization at OSU that focused on all forms of web development.  The group has weekly meetings focusing on design, development, best-practice, and inovative new software.  CWDG's focus on the broud topic of web development allows for exploration into numerous languages including JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, php, etc.  The group also talks about major industry standards such as version control and prototyping.  <a href="http://cwdg.herokuapp.com/">CWDG</a></p>
				<p>This group, personally, is one of the best run on campus.  It's flexable structure inwhich members volunteer to create and present presentations allows web developers of all skill levels to grow, develop, and learn new tips and tricks.</p>

				<h1>BSA Troop 123</h1>
				<p>Troop 123 and the Boy Scouts of America taught me about the world fundimentals leadership, teamwork, and commitment.  It's emphase on character and community development are defining features of my jounior hight and high school careers.  I made numerous friends and gained unparrelled knowledge.  <a href="http://www.http://troop123.org/">Troop 123</a></p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout.  My project was the constructions of two bridges (48ft & 12ft) at Aluum Creek State Park.  The project supported the Central Ohio Mountain Biking Organization.  The project was awarded the Buckeye District 2013 Andreas Garnes Eagle Scout Service Project of the year.</p>

			<div>
				<h1>Columbus Startup Weekend</h1>
				<p>This experience afforded me many great opportunities.  Firstly, the experience of working in a team in which, going into the event, I knew nothing about any of my fellow members.  Secondly, the event allowed me to not only take a project/vision from basic idea, to business model, to minimum viable produce.  Lastly, the event allowed me to present my own unique idea and get feedback from my peers.  These are all specific elements that I took away from the experience, along with the events networking, and project driven core.  I participated due to the high recommendations which my fellow NEWPATH members placed on the event. <a href="http://www.http://columbus.startupweekend.org/">Columbus Startup Weekend</a></p>

				<h1>CSE Help Desk Staff</h1>
				<p>The biggest perk of this job is the constant interaction with faculty members.  You get a glimpse into the world of research, the world of the future.  It implants that seed that they are there to further your development.  During this job I worked as a Help Desk operator.  Which means that I managed all of the CSE assets including printers, etc.</p>

				<h1>Camp Lazarus Summer Camp Staff</h1>
				<p>During this job I worked as an assistant director of scout skills.  I taught first to fifth graders numerous scouts skills including fire making, knife safety, knots, first aid, etc.  This job taught me about dealing with people.</p>
				<p>During this job I worked as an assistant director of scout skills.  The major advantage of the job was how it got me involved in the education of others.  It is one thing to know how to do something, it is another thing to be able to communicate/teach it to someone else.  I taught first to fifth graders numerous scouts skills including fire making, knife safety, knots, first aid, etc.</p>
